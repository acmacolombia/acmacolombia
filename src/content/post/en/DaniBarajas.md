Recently, I had the incredible opportunity to win the ACMA Flight Experience Scholarship, which allowed me to fly an airplane for the first time. The feeling of controlling the aircraft in the air was simply amazing and filled me with an indescribable thrill. That experience awakened in me the desire to go ahead and obtain my private pilot's license, a dream I am now determined to achieve.

During the 2023-2024 academic year, I was the project manager of the [AIAA Panther Rocket Team](https://www.instagram.com/aiaaft.rocket.team/) at my university. This role allowed me to lead a talented and committed group, and together we achieved an impressive milestone: the successful launch of our “Rook 2.0” rocket. Watching the rocket soar to an altitude of 9,258 feet in just 23 seconds, reaching a speed of Mach 1.1, was an electrifying experience. The launch was not only exciting, but also concluded with a safe recovery, which sealed our success.

This year as a project manager taught me a lot about leadership, teamwork and the importance of perseverance. I am excited to share that I was recently re-elected to lead the team for the 2024-2025 academic year. With my team, we are seeking sponsors for a number of ambitious projects we want to pursue. Although we have many challenges ahead of us, I am confident that it will be a year full of learning and great achievements.

In addition to my responsibilities with the AIAA Panther Rocket Team, I am about to begin my third year of college, known as Junior year. For the past year, I have had the privilege of interning with Larsen Motorsports (LMS), one of the most prestigious jet racing exhibition teams in the world. LMS has won two world championships with the IHRA Nitro Jam series and has six elite jet racing teams that are crowd favorites.

At LMS, I have worked closely with the Aerospace Technology Group, where I have been able to apply the knowledge gained in the classroom to practical situations. This experience has been invaluable to my education, providing me with crucial practical skills and bringing me one step closer to my dream of working in the aerospace industry.

This journey has been incredible so far, and I am excited for what the future has in store. I am determined to keep pursuing my goals and continue to learn and grow in this exciting field!
