## 

The Colombian Association of Women in Aerospace (ACMA) offers three women the opportunity to get one step closer to their aspirations through scholarships to experience what it means to be a pilot for a day at the Aviation Academy Academia Antioque침a de Aviaci칩n. This opportunity, provided by associated professionals, shows that the sky is not the limit for those who dream big. The experience includes theoretical and practical lessons in a flight simulator, and culminates with the unforgettable experience of flying an aircraft.

We are pleased to announce the three lucky winners of our scholarships for a unique experience. This award is not only a recognition of their dreams and passions, but also an invitation to **continue breaking barriers and building a future where women have a prominent presence in the aerospace field**.

To them, we say: get ready for takeoff. Congratulations!
