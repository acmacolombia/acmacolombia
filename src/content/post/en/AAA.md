## 

The Colombian Association of Women in Aerospace (ACMA) offers three women the opportunity to come one step closer to their aspirations through scholarships to experience what it means to be a pilot for a day at the Aviation Academy Academia Antioqueña de Aviación. This opportunity, provided thanks to associated professionals, shows that the sky is not the limit for those who dream big. The experience includes theoretical lessons, practice in a flight simulator, and culminates with the unforgettable experience of flying an aircraft.

We are pleased to announce the three winners of our scholarships for a unique experience. This award is not only a recognition of their dreams and passions but also an invitation to **continue breaking barriers and building a future where women have a prominent presence in the aerospace field**.

The three outstanding winners of our scholarships are: María Camila Moreno Vergara, Ángela Gabriela Rosero Carrera, and Liceth Daniela Barajas Moreno. Each of them personifies the dedication, talent, and passion for the aerospace field that ACMA seeks to inspire and support.

To them, we say: prepare for takeoff. Congratulations María Camila, Ángela, and Daniela!

If you want to support us to continue offering these opportunities or are interested in applying for future scholarships and programs, we invite you to join and follow us on our social networks.

Together we can make many more dreams come true!
