At the **Colombian Association of Women in Aerospace (ACMA)**, we are proud to launch the **ACMA Mentorship Program**, a global initiative that connects mentors with women who are currently studying or working in the aerospace field.

This initiative is part of ACMA’s commitment to equity, inclusion, and the development of female leadership in the aerospace industry. Our goal is to build a strong network of support, guidance, and inspiration for future women leaders.

### What is the program about?

The program is designed to provide personalized support in areas such as professional development, strengthening of technical skills, preparation for scholarships and graduate programs, as well as guidance on academic and job opportunities at both national and international levels.

Each mentor will be paired with a mentee to work together on defined goals, strengthening various competencies and skills.

### Why become a mentor in this program?

Becoming an ACMA mentor means much more than simply sharing your time and experience:  
It means being a **change agent**. It means **actively contributing to closing the gender gap** in the aerospace sector. It means **inspiring new generations to dream bigger**.

As a mentor, you will have the opportunity to:

* Make a direct impact on the lives and careers of women in aerospace.
* Expand your professional network in an international and collaborative environment.
* Be an active part of a diverse, empathetic, and change-driven community.

## Who can be a mentor?

We are looking for professionals from anywhere in the world with experience in engineering, science, technology, research, project management, or related fields—ideally with an aerospace focus.  
We also welcome **male allies** committed to gender equity.  
A minimum availability of **one hour per month** is required.

## How to apply?

Joining is easy. Just:

* [Fill out this registration form.](https://forms.gle/XtP9cpzLPWABVgLw6)
* Attach your professional profile (CV, experience summary, or portfolio).
* That’s it! Our team will contact you to continue with the selection and matching process.

Once the group of mentors is confirmed, we will open the call for mentees interested in receiving mentorship.  
The program will prioritize key topics such as access to educational opportunities, leadership, scholarship applications, and professional development.

Together, we continue building a diverse constellation. We look forward to hearing from you! ✨
